.SH NAME
plzip \- reduces the size of files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B plzip
[\fI\,options\/\fR] [\fI\,files\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Plzip is a massively parallel (multi\-threaded) implementation of lzip, fully
compatible with lzip 1.4 or newer. Plzip uses the compression library lzlib.
.PP
Lzip is a lossless data compressor with a user interface similar to the one
of gzip or bzip2. Lzip uses a simplified form of the 'Lempel\-Ziv\-Markov
chain\-Algorithm' (LZMA) stream format and provides a 3 factor integrity
checking to maximize interoperability and optimize safety. Lzip can compress
about as fast as gzip (lzip \fB\-0\fR) or compress most files more than bzip2
(lzip \fB\-9\fR). Decompression speed is intermediate between gzip and bzip2.
Lzip is better than gzip and bzip2 from a data recovery perspective. Lzip
has been designed, written, and tested with great care to replace gzip and
bzip2 as the standard general\-purpose compressed format for unix\-like
systems.
.PP
Plzip can compress/decompress large files on multiprocessor machines much
faster than lzip, at the cost of a slightly reduced compression ratio (0.4
to 2 percent larger compressed files). Note that the number of usable
threads is limited by file size; on files larger than a few GB plzip can use
hundreds of processors, but on files of only a few MB plzip is no faster
than lzip.

.PP
If no file names are given, or if a file is '\-', plzip compresses or
decompresses from standard input to standard output.
Numbers may be followed by a multiplier: k = kB = 10^3 = 1000,
Ki = KiB = 2^10 = 1024, M = 10^6, Mi = 2^20, G = 10^9, Gi = 2^30, etc...
Dictionary sizes 12 to 29 are interpreted as powers of two, meaning 2^12
to 2^29 bytes.
.PP
The bidimensional parameter space of LZMA can't be mapped to a linear
scale optimal for all files. If your files are large, very repetitive,
etc, you may need to use the options \fB\-\-dictionary\-size\fR and \fB\-\-match\-length\fR
directly to achieve optimal performance.
.PP
To extract all the files from archive 'foo.tar.lz', use the commands
\&'tar \fB\-xf\fR foo.tar.lz' or 'plzip \fB\-cd\fR foo.tar.lz | tar \fB\-xf\fR \-'.
.PP
Exit status: 0 for a normal exit, 1 for environmental problems (file
not found, invalid flags, I/O errors, etc), 2 to indicate a corrupt or
invalid input file, 3 for an internal consistency error (e.g., bug) which
caused plzip to panic.
