Requirements
------------
You will need a C++98 compiler with suport for 'long long', and the
compression library lzlib installed. (gcc 3.3.6 or newer is recommended).
I use gcc 6.1.0 and 3.3.6, but the code should compile with any standards
compliant compiler.

Lzlib must be version 1.0 or newer, but the fast encoder requires lzlib 1.7
or newer, the Hamming distance (HD) = 3 detection of corrupt headers in
non-seekable multimember files requires lzlib 1.10 or newer, and the 'no
copy' optimization for testing requires lzlib 1.12 or newer.

Gcc is available at http://gcc.gnu.org.
Lzlib is available at http://www.nongnu.org/lzip/lzlib.html.

The operating system must allow signal handlers read access to objects with
static storage duration so that the cleanup handler for Control-C can delete
the partial output file.


Procedure
---------
1. Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

	tar -xf plzip[version].tar.lz
or
	lzip -cd plzip[version].tar.lz | tar -xf -

This creates the directory ./plzip[version] containing the source from
the main archive.

2. Change to plzip directory and run configure.
   (Try 'configure --help' for usage instructions).

	cd plzip[version]
	./configure

   To link against a lzlib not installed in a standard place, use:

	./configure CPPFLAGS='-I <includedir>' LDFLAGS='-L <libdir>'

   (Replace <includedir> with the directory containing the file lzlib.h,
            and <libdir> with the directory containing the file liblz.a).

   If you are compiling on MinGW, use --with-mingw (note that the Windows
   I/O functions used with MinGW are not guaranteed to be thread safe):

	./configure --with-mingw CXXFLAGS+='-D __USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO'

3. Run make.

	make

4. Optionally, type 'make check' to run the tests that come with plzip.

5. Type 'make install' to install the program and any data files and
   documentation.

   Or type 'make install-compress', which additionally compresses the
   info manual and the man page after installation.
   (Installing compressed docs may become the default in the future).

   You can install only the program, the info manual, or the man page by
   typing 'make install-bin', 'make install-info', or 'make install-man'
   respectively.

   Instead of 'make install', you can type 'make install-as-lzip' to
   install the program and any data files and documentation, and link
   the program to the name 'lzip'.


Another way
-----------
You can also compile plzip into a separate directory.
To do this, you must use a version of 'make' that supports the variable
'VPATH', such as GNU 'make'. 'cd' to the directory where you want the
object files and executables to go and run the 'configure' script.
'configure' automatically checks for the source code in '.', in '..', and
in the directory that 'configure' is in.

'configure' recognizes the option '--srcdir=DIR' to control where to
look for the sources. Usually 'configure' can determine that directory
automatically.

After running 'configure', you can run 'make' and 'make install' as
explained above.
