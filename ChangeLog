	* Version 0.1 released.
	* This version is based on llzip-0.03 (2009-11-21), written by
	  Laszlo Ersek <lacos@caesar.elte.hu>. Thanks Laszlo!
	  From llzip-0.03/README:

            llzip is a hack on my lbzip2-0.17 release. I ripped out the
            decompression stuff, and replaced the bzip2 compression with
            the lzma compression from lzlib-0.7. llzip is mainly meant
            as an assisted fork point for the lzip developers.
            Nonetheless, I tried to review the diff against lbzip2-0.17
            thoroughly, and I think llzip should be usable on its own
            until something better appears on the net.
